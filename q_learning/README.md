# Grid Example
This short programm is based on an example from the reinforcement learning course. It finds the shortest path in a 3x3 grid world based on q-learning. We also created a step-by-step hand written pdf showing the first iteration of the algorithm. 

### Run
```bash
python gridExample.py
```
