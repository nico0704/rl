# Reinforcment Learning Course WISE 24/25

This repository is a collection of solutions for the reinforcement learning course of Group Three.


## Pre-Project (three-wheel-robot)
#### Functions
This project simulates the movement of a three wheel robot form a starting-point to an ending-point

#### Usage
How to run this:
```bash
cd three_wheel_robot
python twr.py
```

#### Results
These are three example-results of the pre-project:

    <img src="/three_wheel_robot/visus/3.png" alt="First Result" width="350">
</div>


## First Mini-Projects (tabular)
#### Functions
This project is the first mini-project for the reinforcement learning course. It simulates a taxi-driving-system. The taxi drivers goal is to get a passenger and deliver him/her to his/hers destination. It's realised as a graph problem, so the goal is to find the shortest path. To find the shortest path we did a Q-Table. 

#### Usage
How to run this:
```bash
cd tabular
python utils.py
python tabularLearning.py
```

#### Results
This is one example result for the first mini-project

To see some more reults run the code. There are some more visualizations included.
