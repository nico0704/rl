# Reinforcement Learning Course WISE 24/25
This repository is a collection of solutions for the reinforcement learning course of Group Three.

## Pre-Project - [Three Wheel Robot](/three_wheel_robot/)
This project simulates the movement of a three wheel robot form a starting-point to an ending-point.

## Q-Learning by hand - [Q-Learning](/q_learning_by_hand/)
This is our solution to the Q-Learning example. It contains a python realization and a hand-written solution for the q-table updates. 

## Mini-Project Tabular - [Crazy Taxi](/tabular/)
This project is the first mini-project for the reinforcement learning course. It simulates a taxi-driving-system. The taxi drivers goal is to get a passenger and deliver him/her to his/hers destination. It's realised as a graph problem, so the goal is to find the shortest path. To find the shortest path we used Q-Learning.
